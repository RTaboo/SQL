In this project I used SQLite studio

/* Provide a Query of Customers who do not live in the US (Full names , country, customer id) */ 
SELECT customerId FirstName , LastName, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country != 'USA' ;

/* show customers only in Brazil*/ 
SELECT customerId, FirstName, LastName 
FROM customers 
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

/* Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.*/
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM Customers as c , invoices as i 
WHERE c.country= 'Brazil' 
AND c.customerid=i.customerid

/*Show the Employees who are Sales Agents*/
SELECT *
FROM employees 
WHERE title ='Sales Support Agent'

/* Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.*/ 
SELECT distinct billingcountry
FROM invoices 

/* Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.*/
SELECT i.invoiceID, i.Total, e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName 
as "Sales Agent Name" 
FROM Invoices i, Employees e, Customers c 
WHERE i.CustomerId == c.CustomerId 
and c.SupportRepId == e.EmployeeId
 
/*How many Invoices were there in 2009?*/ 
SELECT count(invoiceid) as Totalinvoices
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate like '2009%'

/* What are the total sales for 2009? */ 
SELECT sum(total)
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoicedate like '2009%' 

/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.*/ 
SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.name as track
FROM tracks , invoice_items
on tracks.TrackId= invoice_items.TrackId

/* Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.*/ 
SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId , tracks.name as 'Track', artists.name as 'Artist'
FROM invoice_items
	join tracks on invoice_items.trackid = tracks.trackid
	join albums on albums.albumid = tracks.albumid
